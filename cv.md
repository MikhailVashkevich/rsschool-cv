My goal is to find a dream job, always to be one step ahead.
Teamwork in a friendly and close-knit team is important for me, constant
development of my personal and professional qualities, as well as decent pay
these qualities. I am purposeful, attentive and responsible, I know how to work in a team.
If I do something, then I do it efficiently and thoroughly delving into all the details.
I have no experience in the field of development, but I have a great desire and aspiration
get it!

My skills: HTML, CSS, БЭМ, GIT, Gulp, SCSS.
